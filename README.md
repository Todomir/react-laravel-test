This application is just a simple to-do app to test the integration between **[React](https://reactjs.org)** and **[Laravel](https://laravel.com/)**, using **[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)** for the site navigation.

## Setup

After cloning, don't forget to create a *.env* file and run `php artisan key:generate` to generate a new application key. Also, the *database.sqlite* file must be created at the database folder.

Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies, then run `npm run dev` to transpile all components into vanilla JS. Alternatively, you can run `npm run watch-poll` to listen to modifications on the components.
